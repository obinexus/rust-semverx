SemVerX Website Interaction Design
Core Interactive Components
1. Interactive Architecture Diagram
Component: Dynamic PlantUML-style visualization of the SemVerX system architecture
Interaction: Click on different layers (CDIS, HDIS, QDIS, SemVerX Core) to explore components
Features:
Hover effects reveal detailed component descriptions
Click to drill down into subsystem details
Animated data flow visualization showing how components interact
Toggle between different architectural views (logical, physical, dependency)
2. Version Lifecycle Simulator
Component: Interactive state machine visualization
Interaction: Users can simulate version transitions (Stable → Experimental → Legacy → Stable)
Features:
Drag components through version states
Real-time dependency resolution visualization
Hot-swap simulation showing component replacement
Version conflict resolution scenarios
3. Dependency Graph Explorer
Component: Interactive graph visualization using Eulerian/Hamiltonian cycle algorithms
Interaction: Users can build dependency graphs and watch the system resolve them
Features:
Add/remove nodes (components) and edges (dependencies)
Visualize Eulerian cycles (visit all edges) and Hamiltonian paths (visit all nodes)
Diamond dependency problem resolution
Real-time hot-swap simulation
4. Polyglot System Configurator
Component: Multi-language component integration tool
Interaction: Configure polyglot, hybrid, or monogot system architectures
Features:
Language adapter selection (Python, Rust, Node.js)
FFI (Foreign Function Interface) configuration
Schema definition for different language combinations
Live code generation for cross-language calls
