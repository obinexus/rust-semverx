SemVerX Website Design Style Guide
Design Philosophy
Visual Language
Technical Sophistication: Clean, precise aesthetic that reflects the advanced nature of the SemVerX system
Architectural Clarity: Visual hierarchy that mirrors the layered architecture of the system
Professional Innovation: Modern design that conveys cutting-edge technology while maintaining accessibility
Color Palette
Primary: Deep Navy (#0b0c10) - Background, conveying depth and technical sophistication
Secondary: Teal (#45A29E) - CDIS layer, representing classical deterministic systems
Accent: Cyan (#66FCF1) - HDIS layer, symbolizing hybrid adaptive systems
Highlight: Orange (#FFB347) - SemVerX core, emphasizing the central versioning system
Warning: Coral (#FF6B6B) - Dependency resolution, indicating critical system components
Interface: Light Gray (#C5C6C7) - QDIS layer, representing quantum/exploratory systems
Text: White (#FFFFFF) - Primary text color for high contrast
Typography
Display Font: "JetBrains Mono" - Monospace font for technical precision and code-like aesthetics
Body Font: "Inter" - Clean, highly legible sans-serif for content
Accent Font: "Space Grotesk" - Modern geometric sans-serif for headings
