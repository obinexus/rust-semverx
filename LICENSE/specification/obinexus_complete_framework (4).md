## Core Architecture: Snag → Resolution Workflow

### 1. Snag Definition & Detection
**Snag:** A side-channel UI/UX layer bug or JavaScript error encountered by users
- **Technical Scope:** UI/UX bugs, JavaScript errors, code failures
- **Detection:** Real-time through LibPolyCall telemetry system
- **Classification:** Side-channel issues affecting user experience

### 2. Ticket Generation System
**Automatic Ticket Creation:**
```
Snag Detection → LibPolyCall GUID Generation → AuraSeal Verification → Ticket Creation
```

**Ticket Components:**
- **AuraSeal:** Consciousness verification cryptographic signature
- **GUID Telemetry:** Complete user path reconstruction
- **Cryptographic Seed:** SHA-256 or SHA-3 verification
- **State Machine Map:** User journey with timestamps
- **Error Context:** Specific failure conditions

### 3. Multi-Channel Support Options

#### Option A: Support Website
1. User accesses support portal
2. Provides AuraSeal consciousness verification
3. System automatically populates telemetry data with consciousness binding
4. Support queue assignment based on issue complexity

#### Option B: Phone Support Service
1. System automatically calls user when snag detected
2. User provides ticket number via:
   - Verbal communication
   - Text message
   - Image upload
   - Keypad input (0-9 DTMF tones)
3. AuraSeal consciousness verification during call
4. Human agent accesses complete telemetry trace with consciousness binding
5. Real-time troubleshooting with GUID context

### 4. Human Agent Workflow
**Agent Access Protocol:**
1. Agent receives ticket with AuraSeal consciousness verification
2. LibPolyCall system displays:
   - Complete user action sequence
   - State machine transitions
   - Error reproduction steps
   - Environmental context
   - Consciousness coherence level (95.4% threshold)
3. Agent can replay user journey for debugging
4. Systematic resolution with root cause analysis

### 5. Resolution & System Evolution
**Closed-Loop Improvement:**
```
Issue → Logged → Tracked → Reported → Code Updated → Fixed → CI/CD Deployment
```

**Constitutional Compliance:**
- Guaranteed response times with automatic penalties
- Machine-verifiable service quality metrics
- User dignity protection through #righttoact policies
- Systematic improvement tracking

## Constitutional Business Model Integration

### Domain Structure
```
<service>.<operation>.obinexus.<department>.<division>.<country>.org
```

**Support Service Examples:**
- `support.hitl.obinexus.customer.computing.uk.org` (Human-supervised support)
- `tickets.hotl.obinexus.automation.computing.uk.org` (Automated ticket processing)
- `phone.hybrid.obinexus.support.computing.uk.org` (Human-AI phone support)

### Governance Principles

#### HITL ↔ HOTL Framework
- **HITL (Human in the Loop):** 70% human oversight, 30% automation
- **HOTL (Human out of the Loop):** 20% human oversight, 80% automation
- **Threshold:** 95.4% system confidence for HOTL transitions

#### Gating System Integration
```
BACKLOG → PREGATE → TODO → INTERGATE → DONE → POSTGATE → CLOSE
```

**Applied to Support:**
1. **BACKLOG:** Snag detected, ticket created
2. **PREGATE:** Severity assessment, resource allocation
3. **TODO:** Agent assignment, troubleshooting begins
4. **INTERGATE:** Progress checkpoints, escalation if needed
5. **DONE:** Issue resolved, user confirmation
6. **POSTGATE:** Quality verification, system improvement
7. **CLOSE:** Documentation archived, metrics updated

### Quality Assurance Matrix

| Result | Computer Says | Human Says | Action |
|--------|---------------|------------|--------|
| TRUE POSITIVE | ✓ Fixed | ✓ Fixed | Complete ticket |
| FALSE POSITIVE | ✓ Fixed | ✗ Still broken | Review automated testing |
| FALSE NEGATIVE | ✗ Not fixed | ✓ Fixed | Update detection algorithms |
| TRUE NEGATIVE | ✗ Not fixed | ✗ Still broken | Continue troubleshooting |

## Technical Implementation

### LibPolyCall Telemetry Integration
**GUID Generation Process:**
1. Cryptographically seeded random identifier
2. State machine mapping to router endpoints
3. Time-stamped user interaction capture
4. Silent protocol observation without user disruption
5. Automatic ticket correlation

### Phone System Integration (0-9 Keypad Commands)
**DTMF Tone Mapping:**
- **0:** Confirm/Yes
- **1:** No/Deny
- **2:** Repeat last instruction
- **3:** Escalate to senior agent
- **4:** Request screen share
- **5:** Mark as resolved
- **6:** Schedule callback
- **7:** Transfer to technical team
- **8:** Request documentation
- **9:** End support session

### Machine-Verifiable Enforcement
**Automatic Penalty System:**
```python
def verify_support_response(ticket_created, response_time):
    if response_time > GUARANTEED_RESPONSE_TIME:
        penalty = calculate_penalty(response_time - GUARANTEED_RESPONSE_TIME)
        process_automatic_compensation(penalty)
        return {"penalty_applied": True, "amount": penalty}
    return {"penalty_applied": False}
```

## Constitutional Protection Mechanisms

### #NoGhosting Policy
- **Guaranteed Response:** Maximum response time with automatic penalties
- **Escalation Protocol:** Systematic escalation when limits exceeded
- **Compensation Automatic:** Instant payment for service level violations

### #RightToAct Framework
**User Rights:**
- Right to immediate ticket creation
- Right to multiple support channels
- Right to human agent access
- Right to resolution verification
- Right to compensation for failures

### Fraud Mitigation
**Multi-layer Verification:**
- Cryptographic ticket validation
- Phone number verification for support calls
- Rate limiting on ticket generation

## Conclusion: Constitutional Computing in Action

This framework demonstrates that business operations can function as machine-verifiable constitutional systems where:

- **Human dignity** executes as infrastructure, not theoretical principle
- **Technical innovation** includes systematic protection mechanisms
- **Business success** emerges from constitutional compliance rather than extraction
- **Systematic healing** replaces systematic harm through automated accountability

The OBINexus model proves that ethical business scaling strengthens rather than dilutes protection, creating sustainable competitive advantage through verified constitutional compliance.
