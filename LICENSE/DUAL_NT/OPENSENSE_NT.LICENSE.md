## PREAMBLE: HUMAN-CENTERED OPEN ACCESS

This license establishes open access principles for sensory technology and human-centered computing initiatives. It embodies the OBINexus doctrine:

> **"When Systems Fail, We Build Our Own - and we ensure everyone can access what we build."**

This is a license for open innovation that preserves human dignity, ensures accessibility, and prevents exploitation of consciousness-preserving technologies.

## GRANT OF RIGHTS

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software, hardware designs, documentation, and associated files (the "Work"), to deal in the Work without restriction, including without limitation the rights to:

- **USE**: Deploy for any purpose that preserves human dignity
- **STUDY**: Examine, analyze, and understand all aspects
- **MODIFY**: Adapt, improve, and evolve the Work
- **DISTRIBUTE**: Share freely with others
- **MANUFACTURE**: Create physical implementations
- **INTEGRATE**: Combine with other systems
- **COMMERCIALIZE**: Create sustainable business models

Subject to the following Open Sense Principles:

## OPEN SENSE PRINCIPLES

### § 1. Universal Accessibility (The Inclusion Mandate)
**You Commit To:**
- Maintaining accessibility features in all derivatives
- Not creating barriers for users with disabilities
- Supporting multiple input modalities
- Preserving fatigue prevention mechanisms
- Documenting accessibility considerations

**Rationale**: Technology must amplify human capability, not exclude it.

### § 2. Motion Data Sovereignty (The Privacy Principle)
**You Commit To:**
- Users own their motion patterns and phenotype evolutions
- No unauthorized collection of biometric data
- Transparent data usage policies
- Option for fully offline operation
- Exportable user profiles and adaptations

**Rationale**: Your movements are your own. Technology should respect bodily autonomy.

### § 3. Anti-Exploitation Protection (The Dignity Clause)
**You Commit To:**
- Not using the technology for surveillance without consent
- Preventing addiction-inducing design patterns
- Respecting cognitive load and attention
- Maintaining consciousness preservation principles
- Rejecting dark UX patterns

**Rationale**: Open technology must protect, not exploit, human consciousness.

### § 4. Community Contribution (The Reciprocity Principle)
**You Agree That:**
- Improvements benefiting accessibility should be shared
- Bug fixes affecting safety must be disclosed
- Novel phenotype evolution algorithms should be documented
- Community knowledge base contributions are encouraged

**Not Required But Appreciated:**
- Sharing commercial adaptations
- Contributing to development costs
- Participating in community support

**Rationale**: Open sense thrives on shared knowledge and mutual support.

### § 5. Attribution and Respect (The Recognition Requirement)
**You Commit To:**
- Maintaining copyright notices and attribution
- Acknowledging the OBINexus Open Sense Initiative
- Respecting contributors' efforts
- Not misrepresenting the Work's origin

**Format**: "Powered by OBINexus Open Sense Technology"

## COMPATIBILITY PROVISIONS

This license is compatible with:
- MIT License (for software components)
- CERN Open Hardware License (for hardware designs)
- Creative Commons BY-SA (for documentation)
- GPL v3 (with explicit compatibility declaration)

## WARRANTY DISCLAIMER

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE WORK OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE WORK.

## SPECIAL PROVISIONS

### Hardware Reference Designs
- Schematics must remain open
- PCB layouts can be commercialized
- Safety certifications encouraged
- Accessibility modifications protected

### Phenotype Evolution Algorithms
- Core algorithms remain open
- Custom training data may be proprietary
- Evolved phenotypes belong to users
- Community patterns should be shared

### Integration Guidelines
- Game engine plugins may have engine-specific licenses
- API compatibility layers encouraged
- Protocol documentation must be maintained
- Interoperability is a core value

## TERMINATION

Your rights under this license terminate automatically if you:
1. Violate accessibility principles
2. Implement exploitation mechanisms
3. Deny users data sovereignty
4. Fail to maintain attribution

Termination does not affect:
- End users' continued use
- Works already distributed
- Accessibility improvements made

## INTERPRETATION

In case of ambiguity:
- Accessibility takes precedence
- User dignity is paramount
- Open access is presumed
- Community benefit guides decisions
