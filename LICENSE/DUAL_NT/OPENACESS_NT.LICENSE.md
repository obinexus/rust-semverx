# OBINexus NT License v1.0
**"Use It, Respect It."**

**Copyright (c) 2025 Nnamdi Michael Okpala / OBINexus**

## PREAMBLE: A CONSTITUTIONAL INSTRUMENT

This license is a machine-verifiable extension of the OBINexus Constitutional Framework. It operationalizes the core doctrine:

> **"Good behavior shall be rewarded through systematic progression and enhanced access. Harmful behavior shall be isolated through automated consequence enforcement and permanent exclusion protocols."**

Accepting this license is an agreement to participate in an ethical, constitutional, and self-sustaining digital society. It is a license to build, not just to use.

## PART I: OBINexus CONSTITUTIONAL TERMS

The permission granted below is conditionally subject to the following terms:

### ยง 1.1 Human Rights Respect (The Anti-Harassment Clause)
**You Agree:** Not to engage in, facilitate, or encourage any form of harassment, defamation, or attack on the personal dignity of the authors, contributors, or users of this software. This includes, but is not limited to, coordinated online abuse, ableist discourse, and psychological manipulation campaigns.

**Constitutional Link:** A violation of this term is a direct violation of **Article V: Human Rights & Disability Protection** of the OBINexus Constitutional Framework. It is treated as a high-severity Policy Shuffle event.

**Rationale:** Sustainable innovation cannot exist in a toxic environment. This clause legally protects the psychological safety required for deep, meaningful work, especially for neurodivergent innovators.

### ยง 1.2 Constructive Engagement (The Anti-Entitlement Clause)
**You Agree:** That if you identify issues, bugs, or missing features, your engagement will be constructive. This means contributing solutions (e.g., code patches, detailed bug reports, financial support, documentation) is encouraged; while aimless criticism, repetitive demands, or entitlement without contribution may be considered a form of intellectual pollution.

**Constitutional Link:** This embodies the principle of **#CounteractiveEngagement** and the investment protection protocols of **Article III**. Failure to engage constructively may result in reduced access privileges.

**Rationale:** Infinite resource demands on finite systems lead to collapse. This clause ensures the ecosystem's growth is fueled by contributions, not drained by complaints.

### ยง 1.3 OpenSense Extended (The Sustainability Clause)
**You Agree:** That for enterprise, commercial, or governmental implementations requiring dedicated support, custom features, or integration assistance, such services will be provided under a separate agreement with variable pricing based on organizational needs and capacity. The core software remains free, but labor is valued.

**Constitutional Link:** This provides the economic engine for **Article II: OBINexus Divisions Framework**, ensuring the Computing, Education, and Publishing divisions have a sustainable funding model to feed back into the open-source core.

**Rationale:** True open access requires a sustainable foundation. This clause prevents project abandonment and funds the very innovation you are using.

### ยง 1.4 Governance and Automated Enforcement
**You Agree:** That violations of these Constitutional Terms will be processed by the **OBINexus Constitutional Compliance Engine**. This may include automated analysis of public engagement (e.g., GitHub issues, social media activity, commit histories) to assess compliance.

**Consequence:** Breach of these terms may result in the automatic, permanent revocation of access and usage rights across the OBINexus ecosystem without appeal, pursuant to the enforcement protocols defined in the framework.

## PART II: STANDARD MIT PERMISSIONS
